# Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease that remains a significant global health challenge. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease management. This project aims to develop a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to assist healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of Pulmonary TB


The primary objectives of this project are:
- To design and implement a robust CAD system for the detection and classification of TB from digital Chest X-rays.
- To evaluate the performance of the CAD system and compare it to the accuracy of human experts in TB diagnosis.
- To explore the potential of the CAD system to improve the accessibility and efficiency of TB diagnosis
